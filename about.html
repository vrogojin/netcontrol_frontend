<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is a bioinformatics data analysis pipeline. It is based on the <a href="http://combio.abo.fi/research/network-controlability-project/" target="_new">structural control</a> of linear networks. 
This pipeline generates novel molecular interaction networks by combining pathway data from various public databases, such as <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/" target="_new">KEGG</a> 
(old dump from Spring 2011), <a href="http://www.wikipathways.org/" target="_new">WikiPathways</a> and <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/" target="_new">Pathway Commons</a>. 
The pipeline then identifies a minimal set of nodes needed to control a given, user-defined set of <em>disease-specific essential proteins</em> in the network.</p>

<p>The pipeline can be used by researchers for controlling and better understanding of molecular interaction networks through combinatorial multi-drug therapies, for more efficient therapeutic approaches and personalised medicine.</p>

<p>The pipeline is build within <a href="http://www.anduril.org/" target="_new">Anduril</a> workflow framework and uses <a href="http://csbi.ltdk.helsinki.fi/moksiskaan/" target="_new">Moksiskaan</a> to generate biochemical networks.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Network controllability  focuses on discovering combinations of external interventions that can drive a biological system to a desired configuration. 
In practice, this approach translates into finding a combined multi-drug therapy in order to induce a desired response from a cell; this can lead to developments of novel therapeutic approaches for systemic diseases like cancer.</p>
